# Accessibility

greenID Web has been developed with accessibility in mind.  It is **[WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) AA compliant** and has been developed using the [**WAI-ARIA**](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) principles.

:::note

This compliance does not extend to greenID Web with document validation and facial biometric verification.  If document scan and selfie capture are enabled, greenID Web will not be fully WCAG 2.0 AA compliant

:::

Vision Australia conducted an audit in October 2015 and validated that greenID Web is WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.

The following outlines greenID Web's compliance against relevant WCAG 2.0 requirements.

[greenid-web](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/label/GREEN/greenid-web)

greenID Web has been developed with accessibility in mind.  It is **[WCAG 2.0](http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) AA compliant** and has been developed using the [**WAI-ARIA**](http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria/) principles.

This compliance does not extend to greenID Web with document validation and facial biometric verification.  If document scan and selfie capture are enabled, greenID Web will not be fully WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.



Vision Australia conducted an audit in October 2015 and validated that greenID Web is WCAG 2.0 AA compliant.

The following outlines greenID Web's compliance against relevant WCAG 2.0 requirements.
