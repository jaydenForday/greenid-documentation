# Pre-Requisites

###### Pre-Requisites for Using Document Validation and Facial Biometrics

## **Overview**

To start integrating greenID Web with scans and biometric, customer accounts must be configured to require document scans and facial biometrics.

## **Configuring customer accounts to require document scans**{#Configuring-customer-accounts-to-require-document-scans}

In order to include document scans and facial biometrics in a customer’s workflow, customer accounts needs to be configured to require document scans as part of the rule. Your GBG account representative will work with you to understand your business requirements and facilitate with the account configuration.

Prior to integration, please confirm with your representative that your account has been setup appropriately.

## **Integration Channel**{#Integration-Channel}

If you are attempting to integrate this capability in a native mobile application, we **do not** recommend using Web as this will result in some workflow and user interface (UI) issues. Please refer to our integration guide for [greenID Mobile](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/14286909) for more information about the Mobile SDK. Furthermore, you can also contact your GBG representative to discuss your integration options.

## **Integrating with Salesforce**{#Integrating-with-Salesforce}

If you are integrating greenID Web with Document Validation and Facial Biometrics with a CRM platform such as Salesforce, please reach out to your account representative for more information about the integration and known limitations.
