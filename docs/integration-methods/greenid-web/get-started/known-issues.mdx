| **Issues**                                                                             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Impacted Devices / Browsers / OS\*** |

| **Auto capture camera functionality on specific devices / OS**                         | There may be instances where the capture functionality does not work after the user has granted camera permissions. In this scenario, the user is shown the capture screen, but the ‘start capture’ button does not respond and the user cannot proceed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Rare cases seen on Mac and PC          |
| **Capture page does not load**                                                         | There may be instances where the user provides permission to use the camera, but then the system does not proceed past the ‘Checking device capability’ step and the capture screen is never displayed. This occurs primarily when there is poor network performance.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Any - when poor network connectivity   |
| **Interactive sources - visual styling**                                               | The visual styling of the interactive screens in greenID Web does not yet match the visual styling of the other non-capture screens, such as the instruction screens and the document selection screen. This is coming later in the project. As per standard product functionality, customers can override the styling of the interactive screens with their own CSS file just as they can override any of the screens. However, customers should note that when default styling changes are made to fix this issue, their own custom CSS may be impacted and this will require some re-work on their part. | N/A                                    |
| **Autocapture does not capture**                                                       | It can be difficult to position the document correctly, avoid glare etc in order to get the autocapture to successfully capture the document - especially when using laptops / desktop computers. This should however be improved following recent addition of guidance text and graphics. There is also a ‘manual capture’ option which is now offered if auto capture does not succeed within approximately 15 seconds.                                                                                                                                                                                   | Mac Browsers (Safari, Chrome)          |
| **Document not captured**                                                              | There have been instances where the document capture widget, captures another visible (defined) item instead of the document. This results in an error.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | N/A                                    |
| **Interface freezes during document capture**                                          | There may be instances where the capture interface freezes with the instructions not being updated or changing. This behaviour has been observed on Safari browsers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Safari                                 |
| **Display of calendars on the confirmation screen**                                    | If a user clicks on the calendar icon for date of birth and then expiry date but does not pick a value and then taps the ‘confirm’ button, the calendar is presented with a distorted UI.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | N/A                                    |
| **Document not recognised**                                                            | If the image captured is of poor quality, then OCR results may be poor. Additionally, the document type may not recognised which results in the combo source being in ‘Error’.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Various                                |
| **Selfie capture when camera permissions are not granted**                             | When camera permissions are not granted by the end user - they are able to upload an image of their document but will see a loading screen on the selfie capture screen and will not be able proceed further in the journey. This issue is expected to be addressed in a future release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | Mac (Safari), Windows (Chrome)         |
| **Camera turns on momentarily on Safari before failing to upload on document capture** | While using a Safari browser on Mac, the document capture process fails over to upload (the camera appears to turn on momentarily) but does not load. The user is able to upload an image of their document and then capture a live selfie and complete their journey. This issue is expected to be addressed in a future release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Mac (Safari)                           |
| **Camera permissions blocked for any site on a browser**                               | If camera permissions are blocked in the browser settings (where the user is not prompted to allow permissions when a camera capture is needed), the browser does not load the camera or fail over to upload.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | All OS / Browsers.                     |

| **Liveness - camera permissions denied or camera not supported** | <p>When liveness is enabled and camera permissions are denied or camera is not supported, liveness cannot be performed since it relies on the camera, therefore the selfie capture step is not performed and the user will be presented with an error and greenID will hand back to the customer’s application. The message presented to the user can be customised by customers.</p><p>**Note:** An issue has been identified in this workflow for specific browsers / OS as per the release available from 19th July (Test) / 26th July (Prod). Please refer to the known issue section above. The issue is expected to be addressed in a future release.</p> | N/A                                    | <p>A resolution is being considered with our providers and will be applied when it becomes available.</p><p>As a workaround, we propose that you include a step in your workflow where camera availability is confirmed with the end user before proceeding. In the case where camera is not available, there is an option to trigger an alternative work flow (without scans and biometrics). Please discuss this with your GBG representative.</p> |
| **Supported platforms**                                          | The performance of this capability will vary across browsers, devices and operating systems. Please review our [Operating System / Browser Support](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/1559101483/Supported+Operating+Systems+and+Browsers) and [Browser Compatibility](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/1982726207) pages for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    | N/A                                    | Typically when a platform / hardware is not supported, our provider will present a message to the end user.
