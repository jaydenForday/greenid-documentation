# Data Structures V1

## CurrentStatus

The CurrentStatus object is the sole return type of all the web methods in the API.  It is intended to provide information about what has just happened, as well as giving an overview of the person’s current verification status, and the list of data sources that will help the person become fully verified.  Always presenting this information helps to reduce the chattiness between greenID and the customer application.

| input    | [List\<NameValuePair>](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880477/Data+Structures#DataStructures-NameValuePair) | This member contains a list of names and values that correspond to input parameters to the SetFields web method.  The names are expected to be those that have previously been returned from the GetFields method for a particular data source.  For example, a Visa number will be represented by a NameValuePairwith name=”visa\_number” and value=”11111111”. |

### DateOfBirth

This type is a convenience type for holding a partial date, especially useful for representing dates of birth.  This type holds just the date part, and does not contain any reference to a time component or timezone; this avoids potential issues with date of birth timestamps arising from different timezones.

| **Name** | **Type** | **Description**                                                            |
| -------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| day      | int      | The day component of a date of birth.                                      |
| month    | int      | The month component of a date of birth.                                    |
| year     | int      | The full year component of a date of birth, for example 1975, i.e. not 75. |

## RichVerificationResult

The RichVerificationResult type describes the person’s verification results to date.  This is always returned so that the caller always has the latest results for that person.

| format         | String   | This member indicates the format of the data in this field.  The value of this field will vary according to individual customer configurations.  The most common value is “plain”, which indicates a plain text field.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

### PostOfficeData 

The complex type PostOfficeData has the structure described below.  

This type and the following members are for the most part exact representations of the fields found in an Australia Post contract. The reader should be aware of the individual Australia Post contract they will be using to ensure that they can match up the fields. These fields are retrieved from a flat file and stored in Strings with no interpretation of the meanings of the fields. Not all implementations of an Australia Post contract will have all the fields detailed below.
