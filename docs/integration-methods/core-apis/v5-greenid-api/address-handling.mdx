# Street Types

:::note

From Sep 13, 2022 , greenID will support an [expanded list of street types for AU](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/2193031169/Street+Types#Expanded-Street-Types-for-AU-\(DVS-Australian-Electoral-Roll\)) to ensure that it can support and validate the street types required by the DVS version of the Australia Electoral Roll source. If you are collecting address data and intend to use the new version of the AEC source, it is recommended that you incorporate the expanded list.
