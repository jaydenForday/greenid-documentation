# Background Checks V5

:::note

**API Versions**

This documentation relates to Version 5, the current version of the greenID API. Version 5 became available to customers as of 07 Feb 2024.

:::

Background checks are those checks that are performed upon initial registration of a verification attempt, whether via the regular greenID web services, or the newer greenID API.  Some of the checks are configured for the greenID account being used, but others, such as driver's licence checks, require additional data, but can still be run in background mode.

Background checks must be enabled for your greenID account; please contact greenID to enable the background checks you wish to use.

The types of checks that can be run in background mode are:

- Some driver's licence checks (not all states).

- Most DVS checks - driver's licences, passport, visa and Medicare.

- illion Credit Header.

The rest of this page discusses these types of checks, and what is required to cause them to be run upon registration.

Common to all the checks is the requirement to pass additional data fields in the "extraData" or "optionalData" element of the web service method.  The extraData or optionalData element contains a list of name-value pairs, and if the correct entries are present, then additional background checks will be performed.

## Background DVS Checks

There are four different kinds of DVS checks that can be performed in background mode:

- driver's licence checks (all states);

- Medicare card checks;

- Australian Passport checks; and

- Visa checks.

The sections below provide details on how to initiate each of these checks in background mode.

 If the Australian Electoral Roll is configured for an account there are two ways it can be configured to run in background mode:

1. Always run at registration.

2. Only run when it can verify the individual (this may happen after interactive source checks too). 

For more information about these options, please talk to your GBG representative.

For both cases, explicit consent is required for the source and must be collected by the customer.

## illion Credit Header

 If the illion Credit Header is configured for an account there are two ways it can be run in the background:

1. The default setting is to run the Credit Header for all registrations.  This can only be done when all people registered with greenID have given explicit approval for their details to be tested against the Credit header.  This consent must be obtained by the customer.

2. We can receive a flag via the  extraData or optionalData element to indicate that the person has given explicit approval to be run against the Credit Header.  Add an extraData or optionalData element with the name `dnb-credit-header-consent-given` with the value `true` to indicate that consent has been given.  If you require this option, please contact us.
