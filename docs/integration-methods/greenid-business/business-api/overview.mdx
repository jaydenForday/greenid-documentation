## Purpose of the API

The greenID Business API allows customers to programatically interact with the greenID Business system.

The current version of the API enables customers to extract the details and results of a verification into their own CRM systems, by providing the verification id of the verification they wish to extract. 

The API also enables customers to create a new business verification within the greenID Business system, either via a business register lookup or by manually providing the details.

Future versions of the API will provide additional functionality, such as the ability to be notified when certain events occur in the system, for example when the status of a verification changes.

## System Prerequisites

- The customer must have a greenID account which is enabled for greenID Business

- The customer must be provided with their web service password, this is required for authentication purposes when accessing the API
