# Overview

The greenID Business Admin Panel User Guide is intended for administrators who are performing verifications of businesses using the greenID Business™ application.

## Contacting Support

First try this page and the attached guide for an answer to your question. If you cannot find the answer please contact support for help.

If you are the account holder or the administrator, you can email [greenid.support@gbgplc.com](mailto\:greenid.support@gbgplc.com) with your name and organisation and details of your query and we will be able to assist. This includes questions such as:

- In which countries is greenID Business available?

- Can I add greenID Business to my existing greenID account?

- How do I order greenID Business?

- How do I add users to greenID Business?

If you are not the account holder or administrator you need to contact your local administrator or support team for assistance.

## User Guide

greenID Business uses the greenID Admin Panel interface. For help on features in that interface which are not covered in this greenID Business User Guide please refer to the [Admin Panel Guide](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/14286881/Admin+Panel+Guide). Although this guide describes the business verification process related to verifying individuals associated with a business, it does not include details about the greenID Identity Verification platform — i.e., personal identity verification rules, data sources or configuration options. For those topics see the *greenID Rules Guide and Checklist* for the applicable country.

The [Quick Reference](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/493912407/Quick+Reference+-+Procedures) page at the end of the guide contains links to all the procedures in the guide. If you are familiar with a function and just need instructions on how to perform it, this is where to look. If you’re unfamiliar with the business verification process, we recommend you start with the [Business Verification Workflow](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/491488112/Business+Verification+Workflow). It contains an overview of the workflow and refers to the screens used in each step.

The application itself contains tool tips with context-sensitive help. If you are unsure of what something means, select the question-mark icon for an explanation.
