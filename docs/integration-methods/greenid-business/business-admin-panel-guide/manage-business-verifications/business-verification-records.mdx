# Finding Business Verification Records

By default, the Business Verifications List shows only records assigned to you and records that have not been assigned. The records are also grouped to show overdue records first.

You can apply a different filter or search for specific records using the Find Panel, located above the Business Verifications List. (See [Figure 2](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/492470563/Manage+Business+Verifications#ManageBusinessVerifications-Figure2) for its location.)
