You can navigate to this screen from the [Admin Panel](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/491520911/Admin+Panel) by selecting Business Verification from main menu. You can also access it by selecting **Back to the business list** at the top of the [Verify a Business](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/492307184/Verify+a+business) screen:

By default, the Business Verification Records List shows only records assigned to you and records that have not been assigned. You can display other records by applying a filter or entering search criteria. (See [Finding business verification records](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/492339625/Finding+business+verification+records).)

The columns in the Verification Records List may contain the following:
