# Using the Task Counter

One tool that can help you determine how many verifications are still needed is the task counter. For the primary business being verified, it appears in the Status Panel of the main Verify a Business screen (Item **1** in [Figure 4](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/492307184/Verify+a+business#Verifyabusiness-Figure4)) if there are outstanding tasks.

For an associated business, it appears in the Task button:

The icon next to the counter indicates whether the tasks are on schedule (grey), overdue (orange) or in an error state (blue). If two or more counters appear, the grey icon indicates the total number of remaining verifications required, including any in an overdue or error state. For example, the counters below indicate there are 8 tasks outstanding, 7 of which are overdue:

If you have [greenID Business Search Restrictions](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/514261448/greenID+Business+Search+Restrictions) configured for your account, then there may also be an icon in this task bar indicating that there are 'search restricted' businesses within the structure of this business that may need to be actioned. Each search restricted business which is marked as requiring verification would be counted as 1 task

You can usually tell from looking at the task buttons, which verifications are still needed, but sometimes it’s not so obvious. If the counter indicates tasks are still required, but no task buttons appear on the screen, you might wonder what remains to be done.

Often a required party that has not yet been entered into the record is needed. (Task buttons appear only for entered parties.) For example, if an associated business is a partnership, at least two partners must be entered.\
When in doubt, select(Help) next to the roles listed. If any of them have minimum requirements, the Help text will say so (as shown below):
