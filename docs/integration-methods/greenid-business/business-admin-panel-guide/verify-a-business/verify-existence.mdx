# Verifying the Existence of a Business

In greenID, a business’s existence is verified in one of two ways:

1. By looking it up in an official business register; or

2. By obtaining documents that prove it is a business entity.

The first approach is used if the business has a business number that greenID can look up in a register. For example, if you provided a company number when you created the business verification record, greenID would have looked it up in a company registry and confirmed its existence there. In that case, nothing more is needed to verify the business’s existence. The registry’s name and a “verified” status automatically appears in the Evidence section of the screen (annotated as Item **4** in [Figure 4](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/492307184/Verify+a+business#Verifyabusiness-Figure4)).

The second approach must be used when greenID can’t get verification from an electronic register. In that case, you must upload scanned copies of one or more documents that provide evidence the business exists. (Examples of documentary evidence include certificates of incorporation, partnership agreements, business tax returns, and statutory declarations.) When this approach is used, you (or another administrator) must review the documents and manually verify them.

You can also upload additional documents after existence has been established — say, if your organisation’s policies ask for additional proof of a business’s existence than simply existing on a register. However, if you do upload additional documents, they increase the list of tasks that must be completed for the proof-of-existence requirement to be satisfied. Each document must be either verified or rejected.

Figure 7, below, shows examples of both approaches to verifying evidence:
