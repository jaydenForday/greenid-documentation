# Adding an Associated Party

You can add an associated party to a verification record by selecting the **Add another \<role>** button at the bottom of the section for that role (e.g., **Add another shareholder**):

(Some roles have a maximum limit — e.g., a sole proprietorship allows only one Sole Proprietor. In that case, the button will not appear after the limit is reached.)

If the associated party you wish to add is a business, the Add Associated Party wizard takes you through the same steps as the Verify a Business wizard (see [Figure 3](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/492306827/Creating+a+verification+record#Creatingaverificationrecord-Figure3)), except that the information is saved as part of the main business’s verification record (i.e., it does not create a separate business verification record for the associated business). If you have [Search Restrictions](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/514261448/greenID+Business+Search+Restrictions) configured for your account, then these will be applied to any search performed when adding an associated business. 

If the associated party is an individual, the wizard asks you to enter the person’s name, date of birth and address, as shown in [Figure 8](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=492863966#Addinganassociatedparty-Figure8) below.

The information gathered on this screen will be used to register a personal verification record for this individual when the verification process begins. This personal record is automatically linked to the main business verification record. If identical information is entered for an individual under another role, greenID will recognise it is as the same individual and link it to the original personal verification record. Any changes made to that person’s details or verification status will be reflected under whatever roles it appears.

## Procedure 19. Add an associated party

On the [Verify a Business](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/492307184/Verify+a+business) screen:

1. Navigate to the role under which you want to enter the party. (See [Navigating the associated party tree](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/492307247/Navigating+the+associated+party+tree))

2. Select Add **a/an/another \<role>**. (e.g., “**Add another shareholder**”. The prompt depends on the role and whether an associated party has already been entered under it. If the role has a maximum limit and the limit has been reached, the button will not appear.)

4\. Select **Next** to proceed to the next step, or **Back** to return to a previous step. (You can cancel at any time, by selecting **Cancel adding this \<role>** at the top of the panel.).

Information specific to the role may be requested. If you are unsure about an item, select  next to the role for help.

5\. Select **Finish**.
