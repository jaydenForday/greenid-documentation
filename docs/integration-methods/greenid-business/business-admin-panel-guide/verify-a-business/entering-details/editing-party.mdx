# Editing an Associated Party

When you edit an associated party, the Edit Associated Party wizard is displayed in a panel, as shown in [Figure 9](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/resumedraft.action?draftId=492831345#Editinganassociatedparty-Figure9) below, and the wizard walks you through re-entering details about the business or individual, and then through details about their role.

However, if the information was downloaded from a business register, only the name, date of birth, country of residence, and address of associated individuals may be edited, since those details may have changed since the business was registered and must be accurate for verification purposes. Other details obtained from the register cannot be edited, since they are part of an official record. In that case, the information can only be displayed on the screen:
