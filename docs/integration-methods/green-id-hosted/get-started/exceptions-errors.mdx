# Exceptions and Errors

## **What are Exceptions or Faults?**{#What-are-Exceptions-or-Faults?}

Exceptions or faults may occur before greenID is successfully able to create a registration or retrieve it. For example, when an invalid field is submitted as an input and therefore a registration cannot be created.

Exception data is returned in the following structure which is nested inside an element named `faultData` in the response:

| **Field name** | **Description**                                                                                                  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `faultCode`    | Normally the value `env:Server` to indicate a server-side exception.                                             |
| `faultString`  | A human-readable string indicating the nature of the fault.                                                      |
| `code`         | The name of the exception that occurred. Please refer to the able below for the names of the various exceptions. |
| `details`      | A human-readable string giving further details on the cause of the fault.                                        |

Please note that the structure of the `faultData` element is slightly different between the SOAP and JSON endpoints. For the SOAP endpoint, the elements `code` and `details` are nested inside an element called `faultDetails`. For the JSON endpoint, all elements are in a flat structure in the `faultData` structure.

## **What are Errors?**{#What-are-Errors?}
