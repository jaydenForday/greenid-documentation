# Demo Apps

\<update links below>

Our demonstration sites show how you might incorporate greenID identity verification into your website. The demonstration sites are branded as greenID (this would be replaced with your own branding) and developed using the [greenID Web](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880210/greenID+Web) integration option ([greenID API](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880212/greenID+API) and [greenID Mobile](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/14286909/greenID+Mobile) integrations will be different).

# The process being demonstrated{#DemonstrationSites-Theprocessbeingdemonstrated}

## Step 1 - Collecting basic details{#DemonstrationSites-Step1-Collectingbasicdetails}

The first screen simulates your on-boarding system (or similar) where the individual provides personal details such as full name, date of birth and residential address. This is the minimum information needed to start an identity verification within greenID. 

## Step 2 - Running a background check{#DemonstrationSites-Step2-Runningabackgroundcheck}

When the individual presses submit, and before they see the next screen, the information is passed from your system to greenID to check various data sources (such as electoral rolls) in the background and in real time.

If this background check does not result in a verification, greenID will present further options to help the individual complete their verification.

## Step 3 - Collecting further details via interactive verification{#DemonstrationSites-Step3-Collectingfurtherdetailsviainteractiveverification}

The further options screen demonstrates our greenID fields injected into your on-boarding website to capture further details. This screen shows an additional data source to verify against as well as offering other options under 'choose a different ID option' such as alternative data sources, saving to complete later, and printing for completion at Australia Post. 

## Step 4 - Returning a verification result{#DemonstrationSites-Step4-Returningaverificationresult}

On the final screen the individual has been returned to your original on-boarding process and greenID has returned a result which you may use to decide what happens next in your on-boarding process. In this demonstration, we've used the information from greenID to inform the individual of their verification result and provided an example of the data you can retrieve from greenID for the verification result (this example data would not typically be shown to an individual and is mainly for the purpose of explaining what is returned during this demonstration).

The Australian and New Zealand demonstration sites are different to allow for different data sources in each country.
