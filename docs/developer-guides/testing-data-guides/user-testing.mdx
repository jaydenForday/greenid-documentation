# User Experience Testing

It's also very important that your user experience is tested end-to-end, including both your application screens and the greenID screens, because so much of the success of your online verification depends upon how easy it is for your customers to understand the process.\
\
Some things to watch out for are as follows:

- Is your registration form easy to fill out?  Customers inputting the wrong data in the wrong field can mean they get registered in greenID with details in the wrong fields.  Common issues are date of birth fields that are hard to complete without errors (eg a dropdown list for each element) or asking for 'town/city' when the majority of people live in a 'suburb'.

- Have you made it clear at the start of the process that the customer will require their identification details, such as passport and driver's licence? If you don't do this, you'll find a high dropout rate when the customer hits the greenID screen.

- Are you using a steps indicator on the top of each screen (eg Step 1. Register > Step 2. Confirmation > Step 3. Verify your Identity etc)?  Steps indicators give good feedback to a customer that they are moving through a process, which can help limit dropouts.

- Have you allowed a way for a customer to return to your screen at a later date (ie save & return), and be sent back to greenID to pick up where they left off?  A big usability mistake is to force the customer to start again by not allowing them to return to greenID with the same 'userId'.
