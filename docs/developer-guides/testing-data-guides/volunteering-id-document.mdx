# Volunteering an Id Document for Testing

VIX Verify collects images of ID documents, such as identity cards, driver's licences and passports. These documents are collated into our ID Document Library and used as the basis for testing updates and improvements to our greenID verification software and also software developed by our ultimate Parent entity, GB Group PLC. You should specifically note that your documents may be used for testing outside of Australia and/or New Zealand.

Images are collected on a voluntary basis and VIX understands that individuals volunteer their documents in good faith with an expectation that they will be treated with due care and not used inappropriately.  The following is a summary of what VIX and the GB Group PLC will and will not do in relation to the identity document images it holds.

## In respect to the VIX Verify ID Document Library

### VIX Verify WILL:

1. Package your image into a an encrypted zip file before transmitting it to the operations team in Canberra and/or to the GB Group PLC and/or one or more of their other controlled and owned entities.

2. Ensure that the password for the encrypted zip file is forwarded to the relevant operation team via a  separate medium.

3. Never store the password and the encrypted file together.

4. Acknowledge receipt of your ID Documents along with a reminder of the agreement you entered into.

5. Retain your documents until you tell us otherwise. 

6. Use the documents solely for testing the functionality of greenID and/or other GB Group PLC software.

7. Store your documents in encrypted form at rest. Transmit your documents via encrypted channels.

8. Restrict access to the documents to a limited set of VIX Verify and/or other GB Group PLC staff who are involved in testing. All VIX Verify and GB Group PLC staff undergo background checks prior to employment and agree to protect confidential data.

9. Ensure staff with access to the documents only work from machines with encrypted hard drives.

10. Remain responsible for the collection and holding of your ID document on behalf of the GB Group PLC and/or one or more of their other controlled and owned entities.

11. Ask you to sign a [Deed of Permission (PDF, 93KB)](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/download/attachments/63316434/Deed-of-Permission.pdf?version=4\&modificationDate=1585529194460\&cacheVersion=1\&api=v2) to use your documents.

### VIX Verify WILL NOT:

1. Distribute your ID documents to staff who are not involved in testing greenID and/or other GB Group PLC Software or to other third parties.

2. Allow access to the ID Document Library to staff not involved in testing greenID and/or other GB Group PLC Software or to any other third parties.
