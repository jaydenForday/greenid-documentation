# Registering a Company

:::note

**iFrame Deprecated**

iFrame integration was deprecated in January 2015.

New customers should integrate using either [greenID Web](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880210/greenID+Web) or [greenID API](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880212/greenID+API). Existing customers are encouraged to upgrade the integration method - [contact support](mailto\:support@edentiti.com) to find out more.

This documentation remains to support existing customers with an iFrame integration.

Companies can be registered with greenID via Web Services in a similar manner to individuals

## Security Options

Unlike the individual registration Web Service methods, the company registration Web Service methods only use Password authentication.

## WSDL Locations

The test environment WSDLs for the company registration methods described below are at the following locations:

[https://test-au.vixverify.com/Registrations-Registrations/CompanyVerificationServicesPassword?wsdl](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880210/greenID+Web)

The production environment WSDLs for the company registration methods described below are at the following locations:

[https://au.vixverify.com/Registrations-Registrations/CompanyVerificationServicesPassword?wsdl](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880210/greenID+Web) 

## Methods

There are two methods that can be used to register a company with greenID:

1. registerCompany

2. registerCompanySimpleAddress

One of these methods must be called as the first step when verification of a company is required. This method establishes a registration with GreenID that can be used as the basis of further checks.

### The registerCompany Method

At a minimum the following is needed for the registerCompany web service: 

- customerId

- clientId (your unique ID for the company/fund)

- password (web service password)

- ruleId (default)

- clientType (blank or SMSF - see further info below)

- abn or acn 

- companyName (eg Fund X)

- state (state of company/fund registration)

### Return Value

The return values of the functions are both the same: both methods will return a [RichVerificationResult](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880477/Data+Structures#DataStructures-RichVerificationResult) object.  This object is described in detail in the section on Outcome Notification, so the reader is referred to that section for more detail.  In summary, the return value will indicate the current status of the company's registration, and the outcome of any checks that were performed automatically.

### Faults

Either method may raise a FaultDetails, inside which can be the following codes:

## About the clientType and how it affects which sources are checked

If you register with a clientType set to anything other than "SMSF" (or alternately don't send down a clientType) then the organisation is treated as a company and two "non-consent" checks are performed.  The entity is checked against the ASIC and ABR sources.  If no match is found via these non-consent sources, then a POST to the start page can be performed to allow the details to be tweaked to achieve a match via the user-centric versions of the ASIC and ABR sources.

\
If the clientType is "SMSF" the organisation is registered as a self managed super fund and no non-consent checks are performed (we currently don't have a non-consent version of the super fund lookup). The user-centric SMSF source must be used, and so a POST must be done to the start page as below.

## POSTing to the start page

When redirecting to our site for companies/SMSFs, rather than POSTing to \*start.seam \*as you would when verifying individuals, you POST to *company-start.seam*.   The following post parameters are accepted; their meaning is the same as for the individuals.  The only difference being that "clientId" is the identifier for non-individuals rather than userId:\\

- returnUrl

- cancelUrl

- customerId

- timeoutUrl

- exceptionUrl

- clientId

## The sources

The following are the sources we check non-individuals against:

- ASIC: [http://www.search.asic.gov.au/gns001.html](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880210/greenID+Web)

- ABR: [http://abr.business.gov.au/abrxmlsearch/](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880210/greenID+Web)

- SMSF: [http://superfundlookup.gov.au](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880210/greenID+Web)

## Fuzzy Name Matching

The standard rules run by greenID require exact matches when searching for company names.  This can be problematic given the variation in company names, for example, the many variations of “Proprietary Limited” that may suffix a company name.  The use of ampersands and the word “and” can also cause a problem, along with other punctuation marks such as hyphens, dots, exclamation marks, etc.  The same problem presents itself with superannuation funds.

Thus it is highly desirable to perform non-exact matching on company and superannuation fund names.  greenID provides fuzzy name matching features, and this document describes that fuzziness.

## Fuzzy Company Name Matching{#Registeringacompany-FuzzyCompanyNameMatching}

Company names are first checked for an exact match.  An exact match ignores case, but otherwise the names are untouched.

If an exact match is not found, and the greenID customer permits fuzzy matching, then the fuzzy matching routines are run.  Before any matching is attempted, any combination of “Proprietary”, “Pty”, “Pty.”, “Limited”, “Ltd” and/or “Ltd.” is stripped from the name.  Then ampersands are removed, and spaces are normalized.  Then a case-insensitive match is done.

The table below illustrates some examples.

| **Company name …**     | **… matches**                       |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Example Company        | Example Company Proprietary Limited |
| Example Company        | Example Company Pty. Ltd.           |
| Example Company        | Example Company Proprietary Ltd.    |
| Example Company & Sons | Example Company and Sons            |
| Example Company & Sons | Example Company and Sons Pty Lt     |

## Fuzzy Non-Company Name Matching {#Registeringacompany-FuzzyNon-CompanyNameMatching}

When dealing with superannuation funds, a wide variety of variation is seen.  In particular the phrases “The Trustee for” and “Superannuation Fund” are common prefixes and/or suffixes, and are commonly omitted when entering superannuation fund details.

Similarly to company names, ampersands are stripped and spaces are normalized before matching.  The suffix “fund” is also removed if it is found.  Then a “contains” comparison is performed to take into account the various suffixes and prefixes that are commonly seen.

The table below illustrates some examples

| **Super fund name …** | **… matches**                          |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| My Super Fund         | My Superannuation Fund                 |
| My Super Fund         | The Trustee for My Superannuation Fund |
| Me & My Super Fund    | Me and My Super Fund                   |
