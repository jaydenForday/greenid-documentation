# WSDL Locations

:::note

**iFrame Deprecated**

iFrame integration was deprecated in January 2015.

New customers should integrate using either [greenID Web](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880210/greenID+Web) or [greenID API](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/8880212/greenID+API). Existing customers are encouraged to upgrade the integration method - [contact support](mailto\:support@edentiti.com) to find out more.

This documentation remains to support existing customers with an iFrame integration.

## Test environment

The test environment WSDLs for all methods in this document are at the following locations:  

For Mutual Authentication:

## Production environment

The production environment WSDLs (which will be identical except for the end point) are at the following locations:  

For Mutual Authentication:

## Important Notes about WSDL Usage – Please Read!

GreenID uses WSDL that is automatically generated by JBoss SOAP libraries. This WSDL will typically use a complex type to wrap the return value of a Web Service method. Depending on the platform used to consume GreenID’s Web Services, most notably .NET, the return value of the method may be an object of a type that corresponds to the complex type named in the WSDL, and the actual return value will be a member of that object, also named as per the WSDL.

For example, upon consuming the WSDL for the register method described below, .NET will generate a class called registerResponse which has a member calleduserIdentifier , which is the actual return value of the method.

All of this information is present in the WSDL, but it is worthy of note that exactly how the WSDL is interpreted will vary between platforms.

By way of contrast, a Java platform will typically recognise the return value of the register method as a plain String , and not bother wrapping the return value in its own class.
