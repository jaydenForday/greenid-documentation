# Watchlist Screening - Standard

GBG will be removing the standard PEP and sanctions service provided as part of our core data set in due course. Please discuss options with your Account Manager.

Since the standard service was launched in 2016, AML regulations and customer service expectations have changed.  The standard PEP and sanctions service only searches a limited number of watchlists, and therefore we no longer feel this services meets the needs of our customers.  

## **FAQ's**

### \*\*Why is GBG discontinuing the standard PEP and sanctions service? \*\*

After reviewing the service GBG has decided that it no longer meets the needs of customers looking to uphold a high standard of AML compliance.   

### \*\*What alternatives do I have for PEP and sanction checks? \*\*

GBG offers now offers a Basic Watchlist Screening service featuring industry recognised global PEP and sanctions data.   

### \*\*Will there be any operational impact if I upgrade to Basic Watchlist Screening service?  \*\*

If you upgrade to Basic Watchlist Screening, you may find the comprehensive data returns a higher number of matches than the standard service.  We recommend that customers review matches to ensure that false positives and true matches are identified.  If you are using API there will be changes to the responses you receive, [click here for more information](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/2263646261).

### \*\*What if I don’t want to upgrade to the Basic Watchlist Screening service? \*\*

GBG recommends that you review your compliance obligations and AML risk program.  Some standard watchlist users may not have a requirement to do PEP & sanctions screening, or it may be duplication of other business processes.  For customers that do have a compliance requirement to do PEP and Sanctions screening, the basic service is fit for purpose and easy to add to your greenID configuration. 

### \*\*Why do I have to pay for a service that I was previously getting for free? \*\*

A nominal fee will apply for Basic Watchlist Screening as it gives you access to extensive global PEP and sanctions data and therefore has higher data supply costs. 

### \*\*Is Premium Watchlist screening still available? \*\*

GBG will continue to support the Premium Watchlist screening service for existing customers. However, we encourage customer to consider our new Comprehensive Watchlist services that offer configurability and ongoing monitoring.
