# DVS Driver Licence Card No Change - FAQs

:::note

This change is now enabled in Production for the mandatory states (NSW, SA, WA, NT, TAS, QLD and ACT).

**UPDATE: VIC Card number is being made mandatory at 7 am on 19 December 2022.**

:::

### What is the Driver Licence card number?{#What-is-the-Driver-Licence-card-number’?}

The card number is a unique number attributed to a new version of a Driver Licence in Australia.

### Why is DVS including going to check this field?{#Why-is-DVS-including-going-to-check-this-field?}

Card number is a unique identifier which is updated each time a driver licence is re-issued.  By including card number in the matching criteria, you can validate that the document being presented is the most recently issued document.  This change will help reduce identity crime in Australia.

### Will this number replace the Driver Licence number?{#Will-this-number-replace-the-Driver-Licence-number?}

No. It is intended that both fields will be available to limit the changes required to existing business processes.

### When will the card number become mandatory for matching?{#When-will-the-card-number-become-mandatory-for-matching?}

- The card number will become mandatory for **NSW, ACT, SA, TAS, NT and WA on 1st September.**

- The card number will be come mandatory for **QLD on 7th November 2022.**

- VicRoads is seeing ministerial approval to launch **VIC on 19 December 2022.**

### Why is the change not mandatory for all states?{#Why-is-the-change-not-mandatory-for-all-states?}

Data readiness varies state to state with different technical challenges and timelines to enable driver licence card number.  The intention is for all states to become mandatory.

### How do I know which States are ready for card number matching?{#How-do-I-know-which-States-are-ready-for-card-number-matching?}

GBG will manage this with the Department of Home Affairs.  When a State reaches a critical mass of card number data and becomes a ‘mandatory state’, GBG will activate card number for driver licence matching for that state.

States highlighted in green below are on GBG’s ‘supported states’ list i.e. states that have been confirmed by the DHA as being made mandatory on specified dates.

The table below was updated as of Oct 27, 2022 .  This will be kept up to date as we receive more information from DHA.
