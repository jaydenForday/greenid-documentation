# DVS Credential Protection Register

DVS has established a  **Credential Protection Register (CPR)** where compromised documents can be loaded by document issuers to assist with identifying individuals at risk.   Each document issuer will independently determine the timing and number of documents they will add to the CPR.` `

The register will be checked as part of a DVS verification and if the document is on the register, the transaction will be blocked from verification.   This will appear as a no-match response in greenID.     

The Australian Passport Office have already uploaded compromised passport numbers to the CPR.  If these document numbers are used to validate and identity, greenID will return a no-match response.   

 GBG will endeavor to update this page as Home Affairs notified us when further documents are uploaded. 

### **DVS update 8 November 2022**

A subset of Tasmanian driver licences as well as some New Zealand passport information has been now been added to the register in order prevent the licences or Australian Visas of these individuals from verifying via the DVS.

### **DVS update 6 April 2023**

Additional Australian Passports have been loaded onto the register in response to Latitudes data breach.
