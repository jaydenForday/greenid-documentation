## Constraints

| **Constraint**                                                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | **Workaround**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| **Data validation of share totals**                               | When manually entering shareholder details, we don't validate the integrity or accuracy of values entered for share percentages and number of shares. The onus is on the user to ensure accurate figures are entered. For example - we don't automatically validate that percentages added for share totals don't exceed 100%, or that number of shares across the shareholdings don't exceed the total number of shares in the business.                                                                                                                            | User must ensure that accurate figures are captured                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Australian & New Zealand Companies Only**                       | Currently only verification of Australian and New Zealand Businesses is fully supported.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Non Australian/New Zealand businesses can be added and populated manually if required                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Verifying individuals with Foreign Addresses**                  | Individuals within a business who have Foreign Addresses (i.e. non Australian / New Zealand addresses) cannot be verified using greenID via the Business Verification system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Individuals with foreign addresses need to be verified manually and then marked as ‘Externally Verified’ within the Business Verification system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| **Verification Process is the same for all ‘Levels’ of business** | The rules for a business type (e.g., Company) to be ‘verified’ are the same regardless of where they are within the business structure. Example: Rules for verifying a company are the same whether that company is the business being verified, or a shareholder company of another business.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | If lower-level businesses within the structure do not need to be fully verified, the ‘Verification not Required’ and ‘Externally Verified’ features can be utilised.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Linking of Individuals**                                        | For two occurrences of an individual within a business structure to be identified as the same person, the name and address of each must be **identical**. Any differences at all at the time they are added means they will not be linked. (e.g., One has a middle initial and the other does not, or there is an extra comma in the address means they will be treated as different individuals.)                                                                                                                                                                   | If this occurs and you do not wish to verify the person twice, then they can either be noted as Externally verified, or the ‘link to existing greenID verification’ feature can be used.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **greenID Verification status**                                   | If an individual’s greenID verification is updated/completed within the greenID admin panel (e.g., following ‘pending review’), there is up to a 60 second delay before the status will be reflected in Business Verification. (The user may also need to re-access the business from the ‘manage businesses’ screen for the status to be reflected.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                | This should only ever be encountered if the same user is working simultaneously on a business within Business Verification, and on the verification within greenID (e.g., in separate browser tabs). In this case, once they have completed the verification in greenID, they simply need to wait a minute and then re-access the business from the ‘manage businesses’ screen. |
| **Response Times**                                                | Extended response times are sometimes experienced when retrieving data from Business Registers. This is due to slow responses from those registers and is not within the control of Vix Verify.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Please be patient when retrieving large businesses.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Joint Share Holdings**                                          | Joint shareholdings are not explicitly indicated as such. They are however identified by the same ‘allocation id’ against the shareholders in the joint holding.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Awareness only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **Export of Data**                                                | It is currently not possible to extract the details of a Business Verification into a report or document for retention by the customer. It is however possible to extract the content of a verification via our API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Utilise the greenID Business API to extract details of the verification into your system.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Link to Existing greenID Verification**                         | When you use the ‘link to existing greenID verification function, there are the following constraints\:You have to ensure you enter the correct reference id, there are no system checks to enforce the details on the reference match the details of the individual in greenID BusinessIf you ‘continue verification’ in greenID Business and have not validated the address and entered the DOB in greenID Business, you will be required to do so. If you cannot validate the address, you will need to complete the verification in the greenID core admin panel | Check the details displayed when you enter the id of the verification to be linked in order to ensure it is the correct one.Complete the individual verification in greenID admin panel if you cannot complete it from within greenID Business.                                                                                                                                 |

| **Verifying individuals with Australian / NZ Addresses not in Harmony** | If an individual has an Australian/New Zealand address that cannot be found via the Harmony address validator, then the individual cannot be verified using greenID via the Business Verification system. | These cases should be rare since Harmony has good address coverage. If this occurs, the address can still be recorded, and the individual can be marked as ‘externally verified’ or verified directly via the greenID admin panel and then the verification id ‘linked’ to the individual. |
| **Failed/Abandoned Businesses**                                         | Failed/Abandoned businesses may appear as ‘overdue’ or as having tasks outstanding.                                                                                                                       | Awareness only.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| **Chrome Auto Fill**                                                    | If Chrome auto fill is used for populating an individual’s name and address, the user may be allowed to proceed without validating the address. This may result in system errors occurring.               | Ensure you always validate Australian and New Zealand addresses when adding or editing an individual’s details.                                                                                                                                                                            |
