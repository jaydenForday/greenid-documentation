# V 1.35 November 2019

## Release Dates

**Test**: November 26, 2019

**Production**: November 26, 2019

## In This Release

This release includes a new iOS and Android SDK with improvements and bug fixes for both. The new SDKs are available from [http://greenidmobile.vixverify.com/](http://greenidmobile.vixverify.com/)

The SDKs have been updated with the latest AuthenticID (AID) document and selfie capture widgets. This update resolves a display issue where the document capture widget was appearing out of alignment on specific iOS devices and operating systems.

They also include updates to pinning certificates as the current certificates will expire in April 2020.

## Known Issues

An issue was introduced in this release:

- On iOS, the buttons on the Selfie capture screens are blue, instead of green, and they cannot be styled to other colours.  This will be fixed in the next release of greenID Mobile.  If this is causing issues in your product, please contact our customer support team for an interim patch.
