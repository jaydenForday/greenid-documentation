## Known Issues

Known issues that exist in this release:

- **Document review screen stealing focus**

Under certain rare conditions, it is possible for the document review screen to take focus when the document review screen is ready, even when the mobile application is in the background.

The circumstances that allow this to occur have been minimised. However, it is still possible for this behaviour to occur in rare circumstances.

- **Document capture widget in wrong orientation**

Under certain conditions the document capture widget will be in the wrong orientation relative to the position of the mobile device, i.e. portrait edge detection displayed when the device is physically positioned for landscape. This is an issue with the AID capture tools that was identified with the third-party developer and is known to occur on iPhone X and XS Max.

Existing known issues can be found on the [Known issues in greenID Mobile](https://vixverify.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GREEN/pages/459835177/Known+issues+in+greenID+Mobile) page.
