# DVS Platform Transition

On behalf of the DVS we would like to advise that they will be transitioning to a new service provider – Fujitsu, on  **Sunday 8th October 2023.**

- Start: 00:00 AEST 

- Finish: 08:00 AEST 

### **What does this mean?** {#What-does-this-mean?}

- During this period, you may experience minor intermittent disruption to the DVS service.  

- DVS will restore services to full availability as soon as possible with full connectivity resuming after 08:00am. 

###  **What do you need to do?** {#What-do-you-need-to-do?}

-  *NOTHING*. DVS will manage the migration directly with GBG. 

### **How can I track progress on the change?**{#How-can-I-track-progress-on-the-change?}

- You can visit the [DVS status page](https://dvsstatus.idmatch.gov.au/) and you can register for GBG Status updates [here](https://www.gbgstatus.com/). 

### **What if I experience issues with greenID after the migration?**{#What-if-I-experience-issues-with-greenID-after-the-migration?}

- If you experience any service issues **after 8am 8th October 2023**, please contact our Customer Support team at [customer.support@gbgplc.com](https://dvsstatus.idmatch.gov.au/). 

### **What will I see in greenID when the DVS is unavailable?**{#What-will-I-see-in-greenID-when-the-DVS-is-unavailable?}

- If any DVS sources are unavailable, greenID will report an error for the data source checks. This is in line with current behaviour when DVS sources are not available.

### **Will there be any impacts to DVS Sharepoint?**{#Will-there-be-any-impacts-to-DVS-Sharepoint?}

- For those organisations who have access to DVS Sharepoint, DVS will be in touch with you directly.
