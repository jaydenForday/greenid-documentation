# Business Verfication (KYB)

GreenID Business™ is an add-on application to greenID’s core Verification Services platform. It enables administrators to verify businesses and key parties associated with them from the greenID Admin Panel.

An API is also available for creating new business verification entries in the greenID Business system, and for extracting existing business verification details into your own system. Additional API capabilities, such as notifications of changes in verification status, will be provided in the future.
