# GBG Trust Alerts

GBG Trust: Alert is an early fraud detection solution which is derived from millions of identity verifications. It detects identity takeover at onboarding so organisations can apply a step-up identity process or reject an application altogether. Any alerts generated are flagged with an explainable rule code supporting customer decisioning.

**Please note**, at present alerts are only checked and triggered when all the identity verification rules are met.

To enable this feature, customers have two options:

- **A daily file (via SFTP)** where any alerts raised for a greenID account are reported via a csv file

- **greenID admin panel / API** - display Alerts raised in admin panel and API results (with optional lockout)

For more information about GBG Trust: Alert, please contact your GBG account representation.
