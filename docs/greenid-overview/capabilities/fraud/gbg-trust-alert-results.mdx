- If no configured GBG Trust: Alert rules are raised, the result will be ‘NOT\_FOUND\_ON\_LIST’

- If one or more configured GBG Trust: Alert rules are raised each rule will be listed with a ‘FOUND\_ON\_LIST’ result.

- If a rule is triggered more than once, it will only be listed once.

- If using the lockout functionality, an unlocked rules will not be displayed in the result but any new configured rules are raised after unlock, they will be displayed.
