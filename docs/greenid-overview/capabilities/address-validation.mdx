# Address Validation

You can add Loqate Address Validation service into your greenID implementation to capture accurate addresses in Australia and New Zealand. 

We recommend using address validation to ensure you are capturing and passing correct addresses to greenID.  This will help to improve your match rates as correct address information is passed for matching against the verification data sources.

Loqate Address Validation also improves your customer onboarding or application form by reducing the number of address data fields required to one. (street number, name, city etc.). The address can be captured on one line and split up appropriately by the address validation software.&#x20;

The following is an example of the end-user experience:

You can implement Loqate in your web forms, and/or VIX Verify can implement Loqate  within admin panel forms. 

Contact greenID support for a quote and implementation instructions.
