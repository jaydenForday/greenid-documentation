# SSO Guide{#greenIDOverview-Summary}

## **What is happening?**{#What-is-happening?}

Single Sign On (SSO) is being added as an **optional** feature to access the **greenID Admin Panel**.

***Note:** This feature is independent and does not impact your customer journey through greenID API or Web channel.*

## **What do you need to do?**{#What-do-you-need-to-do?}

If your company currently uses SSO and would like to extend this functionality to the greenID Admin Panel, **please get in touch with your GBG Account Executive/Manager**. **NOTE: This is not enabled automatically or by default.**

To connect to the greenID Admin Panel SSO services you will need to provide the following: ​

- Your SSO Client Organisation Name​

- Your SSO Client ID​

- Your SSO Client secret​

- Your SSO discovery document URL (also referred to as a metadata endpoint)​

- Your organisation domain(s) that require SSO login

​This data will need to be encrypted and sent via a secure file transfer.

## **SSO for greenID**{#SSO-for-greenID}

Implementation of SSO can vary, for greenID we have focused on giving you control over your user account access, including:

1. You control who can have access, and when that access is removed.

2. You control your password rules & enforcement of security features including 2FA.

## **How will the login process work if I am using SSO to login to greenID admin panel?**{#How-will-the-login-process-work-if-I-am-using-SSO-to-login-to-greenID-admin-panel?}

**Prior to logging with SSO your organisation’s domains must be configured to use SSO for greenID admin panel login.**

1. Select login with SSO.

2. Enter your email address on the GBG login screen.

3. Perform authentication checks (password, 2-FA etc.) with your organisation’s identity provider.

4. Login to the greenID admin panel.

## **Important points to note**{#Important-points-to-note}

- User accounts will need to be created and roles assigned within the greenID Admin Panel prior to first login via SSO.

- SSO implementation is based on email domain,

  - any user logging on with an SSO configured domain, must use SSO,

  - email address must be used as login ID.

- SSO logins will not fall-back to non-SSO logins if there is a technical problem, GBG Customer Support will be there to help if any issues arise.​

- The SSO service is managed globally in accordance with GDPR. Login ID’s (user work email addresses) will be encrypted and transmitted to the UK​. For more information on our privacy approach please see [GBG Plc](https://www.gbgplc.com/en/legal-and-regulatory/privacy-approach/)

- GBG support users will retain support account access.​

## **When is it happening?**{#When-is-it-happening?}

SSO will be available in Production on **Wednesday, 4th September 2024.**

**Please contact your GBG Account Executive/Manager** is you are interested in connecting SSO.

## **Will SSO impact your greenID API Integration?**{#Will-SSO-impact-your-greenID-API-Integration?}
