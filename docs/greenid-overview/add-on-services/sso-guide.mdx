# Summary{#greenIDOverview-Summary}

greenID is an identity verification system which collects details about a consumer's identity, or a business structure, and compares them against authoritative sources of identity data to see if there is a match. Authoritative sources include databases, document validation and biometric verification. 

To use greenID, the greenID verification process must be embedded into other systems using API, Web and/or Mobile SDK options. Verification results can be retrieved via those channels and/or via a web-based administrator interface.

# greenID Core{#greenIDOverview-greenIDCore}

The heart of greenID, the core contains:

- **verification process:** which processes identity data, document or biometric verification requests

- **data sources:** the authoritative sources which identity data is compared against

- **rule sets:** which define what constitutes a successful verification or not

- **ancillary services:** other than verification such as watch lists or address validation

- **customer configuration:** the account settings which define the verification options, data sources, rule sets and ancillary services applicable to each customer

Your greenID representative will have provided a Rules Guide and Checklist which outlines how to select configuration options within greenID Core.
