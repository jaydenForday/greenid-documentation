# Import Template Split Address

This template is to be used if you have a data base where the address details are split and in granular form.

All columns to be completed with the exception of the email address (optional).

**ME\_ID** – This column contains the unique reference number.

**DOB** – must be in the format of dd/mm/yyyy

**Country** – Must be either Australia (AU) or New Zealand (NZ) or UK (GB)

**Split\_Address** – this must always have be TRUE – this way greenID knows that this file is a split address format and the file will be processed accordingly.
