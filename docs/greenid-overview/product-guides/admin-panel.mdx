One reason why a record does not appear in your search results even though you are certain that they have been registered with greenID could be due to the record marked as "Hidden" by another Admin user. In this case, please ensure that the check box labelled "Include hidden customers:" is ticked and re-run your search query.

Another reason why a record may not appear in the search results could be due to the record being deleted. Please contact support to investigate this for you.

2. filter your search by Date Created / Date Verified or By Last Action Date

## Results{#AdminPanelGuide-Results}

### What do the various status outcomes mean?{#AdminPanelGuide-Whatdothevariousstatusoutcomesmean?}

There are various Status outcomes which are defined below:

1. Verified - The user has been verified against the given rule set.

2. Verified (by admin) - The user was manually verified by an administrator through the admin panel.

3. Verified with changes - The user was verified against the given rule set, however some minor changes were made to the data in order to get the result. These changes are included in the rule set as acceptable changes.

4. In progress - The user has not yet been verified, as greenID allows further checks to be performed at any time this can be considered as not yet meeting the rule set requirements for verification.

5. Pending review - The user has been verified against the rule set, but to do so they changed data in a way that is not considered acceptable without further action.

6. Locked out - The user has been locked out completely. This will occur depending on the customer lock out rules. By default there are no lock out rules.

### What is the blue exclamation mark beside the data source found when looking to a particular customers verification outcome?{#AdminPanelGuide-Whatistheblueexclamationmarkbesidethedatasourcefoundwhenlookingtoaparticularcustomersverificationoutcome?}

This symbol represents an error has occurred with the data source in question when the verification check took place. The source could have been experiencing a outage or a timeout occurred at the time of the check. If you notice this error appearing regularly, please contact support and include any customer reference numbers to help assist us with our investigation. Please remember not to include any customer identifiers such as DoB or Government ID document details as we can search for the records based on the reference number you provide us with.

### How can a customer be verified using a different first name than the one they initially registered with?{#AdminPanelGuide-Howcanacustomerbeverifiedusingadifferentfirstnamethantheonetheyinitiallyregisteredwith?}

Sometimes individuals register with an abbreviated name (e.g. “Mike”) but need to type the full version of their name in order to get a match on a data source (e.g. “Michael”). This module is a part of the controlled changes which can be turned on or off, allows any abbreviated name found on the list at Annex A to match as ‘Verified With Changes’.

If you believe this module should not be enabled, please contact support.

If this sub menu is missing from your admin panel, it could mean that there is a custom rule enabled on the account. In this case, please contact support.
